sketchbook-plugin
=================

Tumblr style portfolio plugin built for Foundation 4 and WordPress. Uses native WP ajax and F4's Reveal modal pop-up. The plugin is an add-on for Milo Huang's Reverie theme framework https://github.com/milohuang/reverie. While it has been tested and works with Reverie it may possibly work with any WordPress theme built on Foundation 4 with modifications.
